This file describes the list of various files submitted and details about them.

The list of files submitted are :
---------------------------------
- runge-kutta.c :
    This is the file which contains the implementation of runge-kutta method to
    solve the differential equation for x(t).

    This program can be compiled using the following :
    - cc -o runge-kutta runge-kutta.c -lm

    The program takes the following parameters :

    Usage : ./runge-kutta -h <h_val> -x <x0> -l <lambda_val> -u <mu_val> [-p n]
     -h <h_val>      : Where h_val is the integration step for Runge-Kutta method
     -x <x0>         : Where x0 is the initial number of customers in the system at time t=0
     -l <lambda_val> : Where lambda_val is the Poissonian incoming rate
     -u <mu_val>     : Where mu_val is the Exponential service rate
     -p <n>          : Where n is the number of customers for which we need probability P(N=n)


- ans-q3-find-best-h.sh :
    This is a shell script which computes x(t) for different integration steps
    (ie. h = 3, 1, 0.01, 0.001, 0.0001). The output of these computations are fed
    to the gnuplot script "ans-q3-plot.p" which plots these results.

- ans-q3-plot.p :
    This is the gnuplot script for plotting x(t) for different
    values of h (ie. h = 3, 1, 0.01, 0.001, 0.0001).
    
- ans-q3-a-b-c-d.sh :
    This is the script which computes and plots x(t) for the following cases :
    - (a) lambda=0.8, mu=1, x(t=0)=0
    - (b) lambda=0.8, mu=1, x(t=0)=6
    - (c) lambda=0.8, mu=1, x(t=0)=0
    - (d) lambda=0.8, mu=1, x(t=0)=3

    This script uses the gnuplot script "ans-q3-a-b-c-d-plot.p" to plot the graphs
    using the results generated for the above.

- ans-q3-a-b-c-d-plot.p :
    This is the gnuplot script which plots x(t) for the results generated
    in "ans-q3-a-b-c-d.sh".

- ans-q4-a-b.sh :
    This script computes and plots the state probabilities for the
    following cases :
      - (a) P3(t) for lambda=0.8, mu=1, x(t=0)=0
      - (b) P1(t) for lambda=0.6, mu=1, x(t=0)=0

    It uses the gnuplot script "ans-q4-a-b-plot.p" to plot the results generated
    above.

- ans-q4-a-b-plot.p :
    This is the gnuplot script used to plot the state probabilites generated by
    the script "ans-q4-a-b.sh".

- Data (result) files generated by various scripts above :
