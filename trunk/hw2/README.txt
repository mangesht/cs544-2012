This file describes the list of various files submitted and details about them.

The list of files submitted are :
---------------------------------
- mva.c :
    This is the file which contains the implementation of Accurate Mean Value
    Analysis method to analyze Closed Multiclass Queueing Networks. 

    This program can be compiled using the following :
    - cc -o mva mva.c

    The program does not take any arguments and can be directly executed as :
    $ ./mva

    The program prints the various values of residence-times, throughput and
    mean number of customer in different queues every iteration (ie. every node
    of the population vector (20,15).

    It finally prints the values needed for Q3.a and Q3.b.

- mva.out :
    This is a sample output of the program ./mva as described above.
    The last sections of this file are used to plot the graphs for Q3.a and
    Q3.b. 

- ans-q3a-plot.p
    This is the gnuplot script for plotting Workload#2 throughput as a function
    of k for the population vector(20, k),k=0,1,2,3,...,15.

- ans-q3b-plot.p :
    This is the gnuplot script for plotting Mean number of Workload#1 customers
    at CPU as a func. of m for the population vector (m, 15), m=0,1,2,3,..., 20

- Data (result) files generated by various scripts above :
    - output-3.a.dat        : Results for Q3.a
    - output-3.b.dat        : Results for Q3.b
    - output-3.a.500.dat    : Results for Q3.a with number of workload#2 customers incresed to 500
    - output-3.b.500.dat    : Results for Q3.a with number of workload#1 customers incresed to 500
